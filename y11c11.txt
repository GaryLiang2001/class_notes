		Rules

			1 ) Bring your notebook and your student planner.

			2) Do not bring any food in here. Or drinks. 

			3) Before we leave the classroom:
				all tables must be cleared

				all computers must be turned off.

				there must be no trash on the floor. 


			4) never change anything on these computers. Never change the background, never change the settings. 

			5) Never download anything on these computers. Don't download an image, software, anything, unless I expressly tell you to.

			6) Never go on any website unless I expressly tell you to. The only allowed websites without permission are university websites and baidu translate. 


			7) IT IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE TO BE DOING NOTHING
				a) you can't say, I don't know what to do.

				b) you must be actively trying to find out what to do. 

				c) Write down three things if you have a problem.
					1) What steps the instructions I gave said to do

					2) Which step you are having trouble with

					3) What command you tried to do to complete the step

					4) What error message (or other error) you received

				d) After you have written all the things down from 7(c) please raise your hand. 

				e) If I see you ever not doing anything, being "lost" is not an acceptable answer. "I don't know what to do" is never an acceptable excuse to not doing anything or not having made appreciable progress in class. 

				f) If you don't know what to do, you must either be activetly asking a classmate (or if no classmate knows the teacher) what the instructions are (or where the instrucitons can be found).

				g) If you know what you should do but are receiving an error, you should be writing down 7(c)2-4:
					2) Which step you are having trouble with

					3) What command you tried to do to complete the step

					4) What error message (or other error) you received

	Homework
		Finish all the logistic regression quizzes.

		If you haven't already, please read the chapters I sent you on logistic regression. 

		Read and understand all of the Logistic Regression: Titanic Dataset Lesson:

			Describe all the parts that you don't understand. 



	Notes:

		Machine learning is divided into 3 categories

			Supervised Learning

			Unsupervised Learning

			Reinforcement Learning

		Supervised Learning
			Is split into 2 categories

				Classification Problems
					Predict a continuous output value

					The important thing about classification is that the class is finite. 
				Regression
					Predict a continuous output value

		Regression
			Algoirthims:
				Linear Regression


		Classification
			Algorithims:
				Logistic Regression

	Class Comments:
		- Many students were absent
		- Wasn't a very focused class.
		- Mike did very well and was quite active in class. He was often the only answering most of the questions.
		- The second half of class the class did a much better job. When it came down to actually doing work, they got much more focused. 
		- Celio was alseep, not paying attention, or disrupting class.
		- Alice should use her own computer. She never listens when I ask. I have to ask multiple times. 
		- Alex often loses track of where we were in class. But he seemed quite dedicated to being a good student. 
		- Students overrall were a C+. Many student I did not mention did well. 
		- Students are getting better at note taking, and learning how to "troubleshoot" their problems (aka problem solving). 
		- Students should be reminded to go through the steps if they are lost -
			- Where are the directions
			- What are the steps?
			- What step did I finish last?
			- What step can I not finish?
				- Can I not understand "what" to do?
				- Can I not understand "how" to do it
				- I understand what and how to do but I am not getting the right result
					- Ask classmates
					- Ask teacher

		- Only Mike
	Homework:
		Everyone to finish all quizzes from Github Basics Lesson.

		1) If you didn't finish writing the code, please read all the section from the Github basics Lesson


12/12/2018
	

	Getting started
		1) cd into your_name folder
		2) create a folder called student_fighter
		3) cd into student_fighter folder
		4) create a file called student_fighter.py
		5) open sublime and type your code inside of your student_fighter.py
		6) run your student_fighter.py python script
		7) confirmed that your output is correct.
		8) take lesson quiz
		9) Move to next step
			- Repeat
	Common Questions:
		1) How to open sublime.
			subl .
		2) How to run a python script?
			python3 name_of_your_script

	Homework:
		- Finish all Simple Video Game Quizzes
		- Must be finished by next week.
		- NO EXCUSES. I DON'T UNDERSTAND ISN'T AN EXCUSE. IF YOU DON'T TAKE ANY STEPS TO ASK ME (I.E., CONTACT BANZHUREN OR SEND ENGRADE MESSAGE) THEN YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND.
		- YOU MUST REMEMBER WHICH COMPUTER YOU USED AND WHAT USER YOU WERE LOGGED INTO
			- NO EXCUSES. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS NO EXCUSES.




1) cd into your name folder
YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO CONFIRM THAT YOU DID EACH STEP CORRECT
	- open your terminal
	- cd Documents <--- don't forget capital D
		- Use TAB!
	- ls 
		- this checks the contents of your current folder.
	- cd into your folder
		- If you see your folder
			- cd into it
		- if you don't see your folder
			- create it
				- mkdir your_name
	- 
1) Open your terminal
2) cd in Documents
	- PLEASE USE TAB
	- cd Documents
		- Verify IT IS DONE CORRECTLY
			- HOW TO VERIFY?
				- Look at the top of the window, check the name at the end.

3) check if your name folder exisits
	- ls
		- this command shows you the contents of your current folder.
4) if your name exists, cd into it. If your name doesn't exist, create your folder, and then cd into it.
	- Create your name folder
		- mkdir your_name
	- cd into your folder
		- cd your_name
5) How to check if you have entered your ~/Documents/your_name folder
	- look at the top of hte screen and read the name.
6) activate your virtual environment - source ~/machine_learning_venv/bin/activate
	- IF YOU ARE NOT USING TAB YOU ARE NOT DOING IT CORRECTLY. 
	- How to check it is done correctly
		- 
7) grab project from my github.
8) know how to get to my github
	- github.com/kaluemekalu/
	- go to my repositories
	- click on the repository you want
	- copy the repository address
9) git clone your_repo_address_that_you_copied
10) cd into the repository that you just downloaded
11) enter your python interactive interperter
	- python
12) import your libraries
	1) import pandas as pd
	2) import numpy as np
13) Start going through the steps of a machine learning problem
14) Answer questions

Sample Question
	1) advertising.csv
		- What is the average age?


Steps of Every Machine Learning Problem
	1) Import your libraries
	2) load your data into a pandas dataframe
	3) Get a basic understanding of your data description, info, and head, columns
	4) Understand your data through visualization
	5) Do your train-test split
	6) Train your Model
	7) Make Predictions
	8) Check Accuracy

	Clone my github repository called numpy_resources
	- How to Clone a repository
		- You need to know two things:
			1) username of respository owner
				- kaluemekalu
			2) name of respository
		Ex:
			- git clone https://github.com/kaluemekalu/numpy_resources

	Homework - Read numpy.pdf An Introduction to Numpy and Scipy pages 1-10

	You can get the pdf in my numpy_resources repository.
